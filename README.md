## CONCEPT

If you have used Pocket before you will have noticed that you can save items *without being connected to the Internet*, Pocket will sync your new or archived items the next time a connection is available. So I missed that option in Raindrop and now it's finally possible!

## Features:

* Save all bookmarks to their respective collections and tags in Raindrop and they will sync the next time a connection is available.

* It is not necessary to have a Raindrop account if you only plan to use the option to save articles in obsidian.

* Automatic (every 10 minutes) or manual synchronization.

* The settings menu has a little bit of Material You (I will improve it over time).

* Save a copy of your bookmarks as an article to read offline on Obsidian [Experimental].

* Select a default collection for quick save.

* Articles include tags, date and a link to the original web site. If the article does not have a cover image, it is replaced with a generic one for "visual consistency".

* It does not connect directly to the website to download the item so it is considerably more private and should theoretically work even if the site is blocked

* Available as XML File project for Tasker or App (Soon)

* No trackers, no analytics, just fly!

### Some useful uses could be:

* Saving multiple inspirational images from multiple sites in a Raindrop collection like a pinterest board,

* Instantly save multiple related links for university research.

* Save different content (images, links, videos) from the same site in a quick and organized way in different collections..

* Local alternative to Pocket

*In a nutshell: any task that requires saving links in batches*

### Instructions:

If you are already familiar with Tasker simply import the project and run the "SETTINGS" task.

Then paste your Raindrop token and press Check (*this will only be necessary the first time*).

Choose a collection to save bookmarks quickly. **The name must be exactly the same as the collection in Raindrop** (no spaces at the end).

### FAQ

**What is the difference compared to saving the link directly using the raindrop app ?**

The process is simpler and shorter using Syrup: copy the link and then tap the option in the notification and you are done.

Using the android share option is significantly longer and not very practical if you have in mind to save a lot of content in a short period of time:

In Chrome for example it would be: open the *menu*, tap *share* (and once *again* if raindrop doesn't appear among the first three options) then *raindrop* and then press *back*. If you have used it before it will appear as a shortcut next to the share option but it is still a process that jumps from one app to another.

### Roadmap

- [ ]  Exclude certain domains, and automate the saving of others.

- [ ]  Create tag set templates for quick sorting.

- [ ]  Synchronize links within files from a given obsidian folder to a given raindrop collection automatically (e.g. move files from Read to later to Archived)

- [ ]  Upload the project to Google Play as a standalone app (still under review) among other options for non Tasker users.

- [ ]  Improve the icon and its name

- [ ]  Import videos history from Libretube to Raindrop

If you find this little tool useful, please consider buy me a coffee so I can keep improving it and adding new features ᵔᴥᵔ
