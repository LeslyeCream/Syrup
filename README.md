## CONCEPT

If you have used Pocket before you will have noticed that you can save items *without being connected to the Internet*, Pocket will sync your new or archived items the next time a connection is available. So I missed that option in Raindrop and now it's finally possible!

## Features:

* Save all bookmarks to their respective collections and tags in Raindrop and they will sync the next time a connection is available.

* It is not necessary to have a Raindrop account if you only plan to use the option to save articles in obsidian.

* Automatic (every 10 minutes) or manual synchronization.

* The settings menu has a little bit of Material You (I will improve it over time).

* Save a copy of your bookmarks as an article to read offline on Obsidian [Experimental].

* Select a default collection for quick save.

* Articles include tags, date and a link to the original web site. If the article does not have a cover image, it is replaced with a generic one for "visual consistency".

* Available as XML File project for Tasker or App (Soon)

* No trackers, no analytics, just fly!

### Some useful uses could be:

Saving multiple inspirational images from multiple sites in a Raindrop collection like a pinterest board,

Instantly save multiple related links for university research.

Save different content (images, links, videos) from the same site in a quick and organized way in different collections.

In a nutshell: any task that requires saving links in batches.

Local alternative to Pocket

### Roadmap

- [ ]  Exclude certain domains, and automate the saving of others.

- [ ]  Create tag set templates for quick sorting.

- [ ]  Synchronize links within files from a given obsidian folder to a given raindrop collection automatically (e.g. move files from Read to later to Archived)

- [ ]  Upload the project to Google Play as a standalone app (still under review) among other options for non Tasker users.

- [ ]  Improve the icon and its name

- [ ]  Import videos history from Libretube to Raindrop
